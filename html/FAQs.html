                <p id="QA1"><b>Do I Have an Anxiety Disorder?</b></p>
                <p>Anxiety is a normal part of living. It’s a biological reaction—the body’s way of telling us something isn’t right. It keeps us from harm’s way and prepares us to act quickly in the face of danger. But if your anxiety becomes overwhelming and persistent, or if it interferes with your regular daily activities, or even makes them impossible, you may have an anxiety disorder.</p>
                <p id="QA2"><b>What are The Five Most Common Types of Anxiety Disorders?</b></p>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</li>
                    <li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD)</li>
                    <li>Panic Disorder</li>
                    <li>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD)</li>
                    <li>Social Phobia</li>
                </ol>
                <p id="QA3"><b>How Are Anxiety Disorders Diagnosed?</b></p>
                <p>Primary care physicians and psychiatrists diagnose someone as having an anxiety disorder if symptoms occur for six months on more days than not, and significantly interfere with the person’s ability to function at home, work or school.</p>
                <p>Doctors perform physical and psychological evaluations to rule out other causes for the symptoms of anxiety. Cardiovascular disease, thyroid problems, menopause, substance abuse and/or drug side effects, such as from steroids, may cause symptoms similar to those of an anxiety disorder.</p>
                <p id="QA4"><b>What Are Common Anxiety Disorder Treatments?</b></p>
                <p>Anxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both such as Psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT), self-help or support groups, stress-management techiniques, antidepressants and so on.</p>

                <li><a href="#QB2">What About Depression Later in Life?</a></li>

            </ol>            
            <p id="QB1"><b>How is Depression Diagnosed and Treated?</b></p>
            <p>The first step to being diagnosed is to visit a doctor for a medical evaluation. Certain medications, and some medical conditions such as thyroid disorder, can cause similar symptoms as depression. A doctor can rule out these possibilities by conducting a physical examination, interview and lab tests. If the doctor eliminates a medical condition as a cause, he or she can implement treatment or refer the patient to a mental health professional.</p>
            <p>Once diagnosed, a person with depression can be treated by various methods. The mainstays of treatment for depression are any of a number of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy, which can also be used in combination.</p>
            <p id="QB2"><b>What About Depression Later in Life?</b></p>
            <p>For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors, such as changes in the brain or body, may be at play. For example, older adults may suffer from restricted blood flow, a condition called ischemia. Over time, blood vessels become less flexible. They may harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body’s organs, including the brain. If this occurs, an older adult with no family or personal history of depression may develop what some doctors call “vascular depression.” Those with vascular depression also may be at risk for a coexisting cardiovascular illness, such as heart disease or a stroke.</p>
            <p id="QB3"><b>What is The Most Promising Recent Development to Treat Depression?</b></p>
            <p>The ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and efficacious antidepressant response by a completely novel mechanism is considered by many experts the most important finding in the depression field in 50 years. Originally developed as an anesthetic, ketamine is an antagonist of the NMDA receptor on a subset of brain cells. It often produces rapid (within hours) antidepressant actions in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antidepressants (i.e., are considered treatment-resistant).</p>
            <p>Ketamine is psychoactive and has potentially dangerous side effects; it has a past history of being abused as a street drug. Studies aimed at characterizing the mechanisms by which ketamine works rapidly and effectively in severely depressed individuals is likely to lead to novel targets and agents that are safer and more long-lasting, and could revolutionize the treatment of depression. Numerous NARSAD Grants support this work, including a number that are attempting to develop ketamine analogs – compounds that act like ketamine but lack its side-effects.</p>

                <li><a href="#QC3">How Is OCD Diagnosed?</a></li>
            </ol> 
                <p id="QC1"><b>At What Age Does OCD Begin?</b></p>
                <p>OCD can start at any time beginning as early as preschool and continuing to adulthood. Age at onset tends to be earlier in males that in females: between ages 6 and 15 years for males and between ages 20 and 29 years for females.</p>
                <p id="QC2"><b>Is OCD Inherited</b></p>
                <p>Research shows that OCD does run in families and that genes likely play a role in the development of the disorder. Genes appear to be only partly responsible for causing the disorder though and it is thought that it is more likely a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences.</p>
                <p id="QC3"><b>How Is OCD Diagnosed?</b></p>
                <p>There are no laboratory or brain imaging tests to diagnose OCD. The diagnosis is made based on the observation and assessment of the person’s symptoms by a mental health professional.</p>

            </ol> 
                <p id="QD1"><b>What Should I Do if I Am in Crisis or Someone I Know Is Considering Suicide?</b></p>
                <p>If you or someone you know has warning signs or symptoms of suicide, particularly if there is a change in the behavior or a new behavior, <b>get help as soon as possible.</b>
                    Often, family and friends are the first to recognize the warning signs of suicide and can take the first step toward helping an at-risk individual find treatment with someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. If someone is telling you that they are going to kill themselves, do not leave them alone. Do not promise anyone that you will keep their suicidal thoughts a secret. Make sure to tell a trusted friend or family member, or if you are a student, an adult with whom you feel comfortable. You can also contact the resources noted below.</p>
                <p id="QD2"><b>What if Someone Is Posting Suicidal Messages on Social Media?</b></p>
                <p>Knowing how to get help for a friend posting suicidal messages on social media can save a life. Many social media sites have a process to report suicidal content and get help for the person posting the message. In addition, many of the social media sites use their analytic capabilities to identify and help report suicidal posts. Each offers different options on how to respond if you see concerning posts about suicide.</p>
                <p id="QD3"><b>If You Ask Someone About Suicide, Does It Put the Idea Into Their Head?</b></p>
                <p>Asking someone about suicide is not harmful. There is a common myth that asking someone about suicide can put the idea into their head. This is not true. Several studies examining this concern have demonstrated that asking people about suicidal thoughts and behavior does not induce or increase such thoughts and experiences. In fact, asking someone directly, “Are you thinking of killing yourself,” can be the best way to identify someone at risk for suicide.</p>

                <li><a href="#QE4">Where can I go to find a support group?</a>
            </ol>
                <p id="QE1"><b>What Are Clinical Trials?</b></p>
                <p>Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.</p>
                <p id="QE2"><b>Where can I go to find therapy?</b></p>
                <p>Different kinds of therapy are more effective based on the nature of the mental health condition and/or symptoms and the person who has them (for example, children will benefit from a therapist who specializes in children’s mental health). However, there are several different types of treatment and therapy that can help.</p>
                <p id="QE3"><b>Where can I learn about types of mental health treatment?</b></p>
                <p>Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two.  However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary & Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team.</p>
                <p id="QE4"><b>Where can I go to find a support group?</b></p>
                <p>Many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members and friends. Some support groups are peer-led, while others may be led by a mental health professional.</p>
