                    A person who have separation anxiety disorder have fears being separated from the people

                    This fear prevents them from being separated with the person they are attached to and to avoid from being alone.

                    Selective mutism occurs when the person fails to speak in a specific social situation 
                    even though they have normal language skill. Selective mutism usually occurs before the age of 5 
                    and is often associated with extreme shyness, fear of social embarrassment, compulsive traits, withdrawal, 
                    clinging behaviour, and temper tantrums. A person diagnosed with selective mutism are usually also diagnosed
                    with other anxiety disorders.
