        <p>Suicidal thoughts are common, and many people experience them when they are undergoing stress or experiencing depression. In most cases, these are temporary and can be treated, but in some cases, they place the individual at risk for attempting or completing suicide.</p>
        <p>If you are feeling suicidal, you might be scared or confused by these feelings. But you are not alone. Many people think about suicide at some point in their lifetime.</p>

        <div id="SWSButton">
            <p>Any of the following could be potential warning signs for suicide:</p>    
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Excessive sadness or moodiness:</b> Long-lasting sadness, mood swings, and unexpected rage.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Hopelessness:</b> Feeling a deep sense of hopelessness about the future, with little expectation that circumstances can improve.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Sudden calmness:</b> Suddenly becoming calm after a period of depression or moodiness can be a sign that the person has made a decision to end his or her life.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Withdrawal:</b> Choosing to be alone and avoiding friends or social activities also are possible symptoms of depression, a leading cause of suicide. This includes the loss of interest or pleasure in activities the person previously enjoyed.</li>
                    <li><b>Changes in personality and/or appearance:</b> A person who is considering suicide might exhibit a change in attitude or behavior, such as speaking or moving with unusual speed or slowness. In addition, the person might suddenly become less concerned about his or her personal appearance.</li>
                    <li><b>Dangerous or self-harmful behavior:</b> Potentially dangerous behavior, such as reckless driving, engaging in unsafe sex, and increased use of drugs and/or alcohol might indicate that the person no longer values his or her life.</li>
                    <li><b>Recent trauma or life crisis:</b>A major life crises might trigger a suicide attempt. Crises include the death of a loved one or pet, divorce or break-up of a relationship, diagnosis of a major illness, loss of a job, or serious financial problems.</li>

            <h3><li>Mental Illness</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People who commit suicide have a mental illness. This includes depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Additionally, mental illness also includes substance-abuse disorders. Substance-abuse disorders include alcoholism (alcohol dependence), alcohol abuse (including binge drinking), as well as dependence on or abuse of any other drug such as heroin, cocaine ("coke", "crack"), methamphetamine ("meth"), opiates/opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, methadone), or others.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3><li>Feeling of Hopelessness</li></h3>
            <nav class="hopelessness"><img src="../images/hopelessness.jpg" width=500px></nav>
            <ul>
                <li>A feeling of hopelessness -- being unable to imagine that things could get better -- is common in depression and related to suicide attempts. People may also describe this as feeling trapped or out of control -- this may or may not be related to a mental illness. Sometimes these feelings can be due to being bullied, abused, raped, or put through other trauma.</li>
                <li>Helplessness, a sense that nothing can be done to change things or to solve their problems, is also commonly described. Neuroscience researchers have tried to understand what biological factors are linked to suicide. Research on suicide is closely tied to research on depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental-health disorders with increased risk of suicide.</li>
                <li>The strongest evidence is linked to the serotonin system in the brain. Serotonin is a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that is involved in mood, anxiety, and impulsivity. Serotonin levels have been found to be lower in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, or "spinal fluid") and brain of suicide victims.</li>
                <li>Neurotransmitters send their signals in the brain by binding to receptors, which are proteins on a nerve cell surface. Some types of serotonin receptors are also decreased.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>  

            <h3><li>Stress</li></h3>
            <nav class="stress"><img src="../images/stress(2).jpg" width=500px></nav>
            <ul>
                <li>Stress levels are also connected to suicide rates. The body's response to stress is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, a system that links part of the brain (hypothalamus) and parts of the endocrine (hormone) system (pituitary and adrenal glands).</li>
                <li>People who committed suicide have been found to have abnormally high activity of this stress activation system. Other brain chemicals, structures, and activity have also shown possible links to suicide, but the evidence is not as strong.</li>
                <li>There is still more that we don't understand about brain changes and suicide, but these findings point us in a direction to hopefully better treat disorders with increased risk of suicide and to possibly identify people at risk for suicide early enough to prevent attempts.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3><li>Loss</li></h3>
            <nav class="grief"><img src="../images/grief.jpg" width=500px></nav>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss is also a reason people consider suicide. Loss could include the death of a friend, family member, or loved one.</li>
                <li>Other triggers may include a breakup, loss of a romantic relationship, a move to another place, loss of housing, a loss of privilege or status, or a loss of freedom.</li>
                <li>It could be financial losses such as losing a job, a house, or business. During times of economic problems (such as the Great Depression or the recent Great Recession), more people attempt suicide.</li>
            </ul>

        <a id="preventions_of_suicidal_thoughts"><h1>Preventions of Suicidal Thoughts</h1></a>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Get professional help.</b> Do everything in your power to get a suicidal person the help he or she needs. Call a crisis line for advice and referrals. Encourage the person to see a mental health professional, help locate a treatment facility, or take them to a doctor’s appointment.</li>
            <li><b>Follow-up on treatment.</b> If the doctor prescribes medication, make sure your friend or loved one takes it as directed. Be aware of possible side effects and be sure to notify the physician if the person seems to be getting worse. It often takes time and persistence to find the medication or therapy that’s right for a particular person.</li>      
            <li><b>Be proactive.</b> Those contemplating suicide often don’t believe they can be helped, so you may have to be more proactive at offering assistance. Saying, “Call me if you need anything” is too vague. Don’t wait for the person to call you or even to return your calls. Drop by, call again, invite the person out.</li>
            <li><b>Encourage positive lifestyle changes,</b> such as a healthy diet, plenty of sleep, and getting out in the sun or into nature for at least 30 minutes each day. Exercise is also extremely important as it releases endorphins, relieves stress, and promotes emotional well-being.</li>       
            <li><b>Make a safety plan.</b> Help the person develop a set of steps he or she promises to follow during a suicidal crisis. It should identify any triggers that may lead to a suicidal crisis, such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Also include contact numbers for the person’s doctor or therapist, as well as friends and family members who will help in an emergency.</li>  
            <li><b>Remove potential means of suicide,</b> such as pills, knives, razors, or firearms. If the person is likely to take an overdose, keep medications locked away or give them out only as the person needs them.</li>
            <li><b>Continue your support over the long haul.</b> Even after the immediate suicidal crisis has passed, stay in touch with the person, periodically checking in or dropping by. Your support is vital to ensure your friend or loved one remains on the recovery track.</li>
